# JS - Pizza Theory

## Level 1:
Elaboration of a pizza with javascript using variables, functions and “console.log()” from a single file (app.js) without modulation.
Expected terminal output: steps followed for the elaboration until the delivery to the customer.
Example of terminal output (it is only an example you don't have to have the same steps):
Output:
mix 30 grams of fresh yeast with 2½ cups of warm water.
add 2 tablespoons of olive oil
add flour
add 1 teaspoon of fine salt
knead well until it is no longer sticky
Shape the dough for 4 pizzas.
4 portions obtained
base for 1 pizza
Let the base for 1 pizza rest for 45 min.
Obtained base with circular shape
added Tomato sauce
added Mozzarella
added Pepperoni
added 4 Black Olives
Baking the pizza for 10 min
Pizza ready
Pizza Delivered

## Level 2:
The software will now allow interaction with the customer via terminal. 

(using the node prompt-sync package).  .
The customer will order the pizza by typing the name of the pizza into the terminal.
The code should be modular
Example of terminal output :
Input:And your pizza is ... (pepperoni): pepperoni

Output:
Pizza pepperoni in preparation
Picking up the dough
Stretching the dough
Adding tomato
Adding mozzarella
Adding pepperoni
Baking the pizza
Pizza ready
Pizza delivered

## Extra Challenge:
The software should allow the preparation of any pizza that is added to the list of available pizzas and if it is not available, the software should allow the preparation of any pizza that is added to the list of available pizzas.

### I added that you can also choose the ingredients after selecting the pizza.
